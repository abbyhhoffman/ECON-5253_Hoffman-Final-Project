# ECON-5253_Hoffman-Final-Project
This repository contains my final project for my Spring 2021 Master's course, Data Science for Economists at the University of Oklahoma under instruction from Dr. Tyler Ransom (ECON5253).The goal of this project was to create regional data sets to see if educational attainment in certain regions in the United States have greater influences on wages comparatively to other regions. The years analyzed were from 2010-2019.The 2010s decade gives the most recent data to analyze. Variables used were regressed on the dependent variable, log(wage). The modeling techniques used were OLS and logistic regression. To reproduce these models, run the script in the .R file found in the repository. Data was obtained from IPUMS ACS data and opened in R through the 'ipumsr' package. To run the data from IPUMS and the St. Louis Federal Reserve in R ensure that you have the ddi, data set (.xlm file), and data from FRED (.csv file) saved in your working directory.
